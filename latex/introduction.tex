\section{Introduction}

Our task was to implement a microcontroller that is able to perform frequency modulation on the Xilinx Spartan 3A Starter Kit FPGA board. The processor should be able to read from the onboard ADC and to write data to the DAC. The microcontroller is based on the Von Neumann Architecture as suggested in the assignment document.
